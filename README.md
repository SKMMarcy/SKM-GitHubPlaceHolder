# SKM-Health Sync

HealthSync is an application where users can sign up, set weight goals, and track daily calorie intake along with other health metrics. At the end of each day, users can view graphs and data analytics of their progress. The app allows users to create notes about their journey. Additionally, users can access a 3D model of the human body, click on different muscle groups, and receive a list of exercises, which can be filtered based on whether gym equipment is needed and whether they are weighted or calisthenics exercises.
